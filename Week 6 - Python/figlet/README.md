## Tips
To implement figlet.py, you can use the following functions:
* sys.argv: This is a list in Python that contains the command-line arguments passed to the script. You can use it to check if the user provided zero or two arguments and process the arguments accordingly.

* random.choice(): This function is from the random module and can be used to select a random item from a list of fonts when the user wants to output text in a random font.

* input(): Use this function to prompt the user for a string of text.
* sys.exit(): This function from the sys module can be used to exit the program with an error message when the user provides invalid command-line arguments.
