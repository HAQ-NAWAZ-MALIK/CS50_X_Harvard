## Tips
To implement bank.py, you can use the following functions:

* input(): This function is used to prompt the user for input. You can use it to get the user's greeting.

* strip(): This function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace characters from a string. You can use it to remove any leading whitespace in the user's greeting.

* lower(): This function is used to convert a string to lowercase. You can use it to treat the user's greeting case-insensitively.

* startswith(): This function checks whether a string starts with a specified substring. You can use it to check if the user's greeting starts with "hello".
