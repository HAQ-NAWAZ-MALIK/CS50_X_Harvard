## Problem 
(https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/3/tideman/)

## Tips

* Tideman was the most challenging problem set in CS50 thus far. It took me a long time to understand.
* Although the codes we need to write are very short, it is not really easy to set up the algorithms.
* Dont give up!
* After each funciton(vote, record_preferences, add_pairs etc) check your code with printf. 
* Test code yourself with different examples.
* You can use the text.txt file to test your program easily. Download the text.txt file to your folder where you tideman program exists and run as ./tideman a b c d < text.txt
* To better understand solve this problem at least twice.
